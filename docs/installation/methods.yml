# Database of HTTPie installation methods. Used to build the docs.
#
# We currently only include here methods for popular systems where we take care of the package,
# or have a good relationship with the maintainers.
#
# Each tool name should be unique (it becomes a linkable header).
# If a tools have `links.setup`, it also needs `links.homepage`.
# Some tools are available on multiple platforms, take into account when editing.
