## About

You are looking at the HTTPie packaging documentation, where you will find valuable information about how we manage to release HTTPie to lots of OSes, including technical data that may be worth reading if you are a package maintainer.

The overall release process starts simple:

1. Do the [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/httpie/) publication.
2. Then, handle company-related tasks.
3. Finally, follow OS-specific steps, described in documents below, to send patches downstream.

## First, PyPi

Let's do the release on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/httpie/).
That is done quite easily by manually triggering the [release workflow](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/actions/workflows/release.yml).

## Then, company-specific tasks

- Update the HTTPie version bundled into termible ([example](https://github.com/httpie/termible/pull/1)).

## Finally, spread dowstream

Find out how we do release new versions for each and every supported OS in the following table.
A more complete state of deployment can be found on [repology](https://repology.org/project/httpie/versions), including unofficial packages.
