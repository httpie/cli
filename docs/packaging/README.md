# HTTPie release process

Welcome on the documentation part of the **HTTPie release process**.

- If you do not know HTTPie, have a look [here](https://httpie.io/cli).
- If you are looking for HTTPie installation or upgrade instructions, then you can find all you need for your OS on [that page](https://httpie.io/docs#installation). In the case you do not find your OS, [let us know](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/issues/).
- If you are looking for technical information about the HTTPie packaging, then you are at the good place.

## About

You are looking at the HTTPie packaging documentation, where you will find valuable information about how we manage to release HTTPie to lots of OSes, including technical data that may be worth reading if you are a package maintainer.

The overall release process starts simple:

1. Bump the version identifiers in the following places:
    - `httpie/__init__.py`
    - `docs/packaging/windows-chocolatey/httpie.nuspec`
    - `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Commit your changes and make a PR against the `master`.
3. Merge the PR, and tag the last commit with your version identifier.
4. Make a GitHub release (by copying the text in `CHANGELOG.md`)
5. Push that release to PyPI (dispatch the `Release PyPI` GitHub action).
6. Once PyPI is ready, push the release to the Snap, Homebrew and Chocolatey with their respective actions.
7. Go to the [`httpie/debian.httpie.io`](https://github.com/httpie/debian.httpie.io) repo and trigger the package index workflow.

## Company-specific tasks

- Blank the `master_and_released_docs_differ_after` value in [config.json](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/blob/master/docs/config.json).
- Update the [contributors list](../contributors).
- Update the HTTPie version bundled into [Termible](https://termible.io/) ([example](https://github.com/httpie/termible/pull/1)).
