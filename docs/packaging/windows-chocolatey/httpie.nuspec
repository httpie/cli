		<description>
HTTPie *aitch-tee-tee-pie* is a user-friendly command-line HTTP client for the API era.
It comes with JSON support, syntax highlighting, persistent sessions, wget-like downloads, plugins, and more.

The project's goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. HTTPie is designed for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with APIs and HTTP servers.
The `http` and `https` commands allow for creating and sending arbitrary HTTP requests. They use simple and natural syntax and provide formatted and colorized output.

Main features:

- Built-in JSON support
- Colorized and formatted terminal output
- Sensible defaults for the API era
- Persistent sessions
- Forms and file uploads
- HTTPS, proxies, and authentication support
- Support for arbitrary request data and headers
- Wget-like downloads
- Extensions API
- Expressive and intuitive syntax
- Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD support
- All that and more in 2 simple commands: `http` + `https`
