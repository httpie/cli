## About

This document contains technical details, where we describe how to create a patch for the latest HTTPie version for Debian GNU/Linux. They apply to Ubuntu as well, and any Debian-derived distributions like MX Linux, Linux Mint, deepin, Pop!_OS, KDE neon, Zorin OS, elementary OS, Kubuntu, Devuan, Linux Lite, Peppermint OS, Lubuntu, antiX, Xubuntu, etc.
We will discuss setting up the environment, installing development tools, installing and testing changes before submitting a patch downstream.

The current maintainer is Bartosz Fenski.
