		HTTPie (pronounced aitch-tee-tee-pie) is a command line HTTP
		client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as
		human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple http command
		that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple
		and natural syntax, and displays colorized output. HTTPie can be
		used for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP
		servers.
