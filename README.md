# HTTPie: human-friendly CLI HTTP client for the API era

HTTPie (pronounced _aitch-tee-tee-pie_) is a command-line HTTP client.
Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible.
HTTPie is designed for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with APIs & HTTP servers.
The `http` & `https` commands allow for creating and sending arbitrary HTTP requests.
They use simple and natural syntax and provide formatted and colorized output.
